We recommend using **Admin Profile** (with and without data) because app provides all the access to the admin user to add all the data to the database and the admin user can also modify the stored data on the database.

You can use Admin Profile for many types of oprations, including:

- Adding Data into Database
- Adding User's ID
- Can Modify Data
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I do this **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you can do this.

On the other hand, If you want to **add a new user and remove a existing one** that kind of operation can be done by **Admin**. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and changes can be done on every request.

In that case, you want to **Add a New Admin User**. It can done by the admin profile.
